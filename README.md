`pypetwalk` is a Python 3 (>= 3.11) library to communicate with the petWALK.control module.

It is intended to be used in custom_component [hapetwalk](https://github.com/p0l0/hapetwalk) for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

Implementation is based on the [petWALK.control local API (beta) (1.0.0)](https://control.petwalk.solutions/doc/api/) and some reverse engineering of the internal Websocket and AWS communication.
